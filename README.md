# currency-converter
An online currency converter to BRL, made with Awesome API (https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/)

On the main folder, run:
```
$ node server.js
```

This will open a port (by default: 3000) - You can change to any port at listen function (server.js)

After opening the port, you can access by typing [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) as a url

If you want to change anything and improve my application, please let me know so we can work togethher :smiley:
